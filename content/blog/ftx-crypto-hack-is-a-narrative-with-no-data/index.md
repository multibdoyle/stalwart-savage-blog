Narratives have always been a part of crypto - even when the narrative is improvised - and most narratives carry an abundance of emotion and a dearth of data. 

That’s the secret to the New York Times’ bit of convict-coddling ‘business’ news - bury the lead (“[Alameda] used FTX customer funds to make the [loan] payments”), and start and end with chin-stroking thought leadership from the thief-in-question. 

“I’m improvising…I think it’s time.” Thanks, Sam Bankman-Fried. No doubt you provided that quote and the associated ‘wide-ranging interview that stretched past midnight’ after some very thorough cost-benefit utilitarian analysis. Teach me, my Effective Altruist overlord!

Another case of good-data-gone-missing: the FTX hacker, using a wallet now-labeled as ‘FTX Accounts Drainer’ on Etherscan, who allegedly stole $477 million of FTX funds in what one analyst has called ‘on-chain token spoofing.’

Um…what? 

Let’s go back to the first principles of crypto, which is that everybody - whether the gatekeepers like it or not - has the ability to see what’s going on with transaction validations. Ipso facto, there aren’t supposed to be any gatekeepers. 

According to Etherscan, the ‘FTX Accounts Drainer’ wallet currently holds $302.7 million across about 50 tokens, about 95% of which ($288 million) is held in Ethereum. 

Other wallet highlights, among the less NSFW items - 1.7 million FTX Bankruptcy tokens, 160 million FTX Sucks tokens - and a whole bunch of other token names which, yeah, seem like they were created to troll FTX. 

But those 228.5K Ethereum - hatchy-matchy! Whatcha gonna do with all that Eth, hacker-boy-girl-they-it? 

The current narrative is that the hacker is an insider; that they’ve panicked; that the Kraken CTO knows who did it. 

Forget the narrative, I’m following the data. Narratives are what the devil uses to soothe your nerves while he’s robbing you blind. 

Until next time.
