Walking around for Saturday lunch throughout 2021, I’ve encountered scores of hungry, happy hypebeasts <a href='https://ny.eater.com/maps/best-korean-corn-dogs-nyc' target='blank'>in line for Korean corn dogs</a> at Two Hands Seoul Fresh (Nolita, East Village) and Oh K-Dog (Lower East Side, West Village). 

Sometimes I think, why can’t I get a corndog? What makes the cool kids deserve a meme-meal, besides a Supreme hoodie and a TikTok account with over 1,000 followers?

I thought the K-dog trend had just about passed me by, until discovering a carb-y, cheesy, very fusion-y menu of deep-fried gems this afternoon at <a href='https://www.yelp.com/biz/mochinut-east-village-new-york' target='blank'>Mochinut</a> — with (almost) no line! 

The half-mozzarella Hot Cheetos dog seemed like an obvious choice for maximum meme-age. I picked up a Lotus-cookie topped Vietnamese coffee mochi donut for the wait, as well as a Bai drink, and had a little moment with <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPOT2tgY9QQ' target='blank'>Ed Sheeran’s ‘South of the Border’</a> on the speakers. 

Such an underrated song. 

Taking the corndog from across the counter, I was impressed by the heft — this thing felt like a small puppy — as well as the angry-red Hot Cheetos coating. K-Dogs, if nothing else, are attention-grabbers, even in a city designed to grab your attention. 

As I bit into the K-dog, steaming mozzarella poured forth like white lava from magma rock. The hot dog inside was of the slim, meek, Oscar Mayer-variety, and was frankly overwhelmed by the abundant mozzarella and spicy-sweet Cheetos covering.

Too much cheese and too much spice, however, has never been a problem for me. I savored every bite of this virally decadent treat -— one of those all-too-rare meme-foods whose taste matches the photogenicity. 

I give an 8.7 out of 10 for the Mochinut Hot Cheetos mozzarella corndog. Believe the hype, and don’t let the cool kids force you out of line — everyone deserves an NYC K-dog.

Until next time.
