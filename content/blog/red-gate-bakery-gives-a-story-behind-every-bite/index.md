<a href='https://redgatebakery.com/' target='blank'>Red Gate Bakery’s</a> sun-bathed, minimalist storefront near the corner of First Street and First Avenue plays host to <a href='https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2020/03/06/red-gate-the-dig/' target='blank'>‘turned up’</a> pastries that follow the instinctual whimsy of owner Greg Rales, rather than conventional trends. 

Peanut Butter Miso, White Chocolate Grapefruit, and a snickerdoodle-cardamom creation called the ‘Cardamodoodle’ cookie all make their home in Red Gate’s glass display case; such variety makes choosing exceptionally difficult. 

After a bout of indecisiveness this afternoon, I went forward with the Spiced+Iced Oatmeal Cookie — covered with a gorgeous cinnamon lacquer — and the big, beautiful Choco-Toffee Cookie. 

Taking a seat at the red-painted table outside, I alternated bites between each cookie and happily considered their similarities; both were thin and chewy, yet rich in browner butter and butterscotch flavor. 

The oatmeal cookie especially, laced with deliciously spicy nooks and crannies, put me over the top. I can imagine myself eating a box of these nostalgia-bombs on Christmas Day ‘22, flat-screen TV running a loop of a crackling fire, snow steadily piling up on the fire escape….

See, Red Gates’ cookies have got me conjuring up stories of my own; such is the magic of creative pastries. 

I give Red Gate a clean 9.0 out of 10; this very well might be the best bakery in the East Village, and believe me, I’ve been testing. More to come on that front ;)

Until next time.
