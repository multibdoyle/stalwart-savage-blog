I’m not sure it’s possible to open a pizza shop in Manhattan right now without offering a rendition of a square Sicilian slice with pepperoni. The madness that <a href='https://ny.eater.com/2019/1/8/18172055/made-in-new-york-pizza-prince-street-spicy-spring-frank-morano-frank-badali' target='blank'>Prince Street Pizza</a> started has got everybody trying to make their own Spicy Spring. I’m not mad at it - in fact, for my money, there are a few shops that do a ‘Gram worth baby ‘roni-loaded ‘za slice better than Prince Street.

One of them is <a href='https://www.unclesamspizzanyc.com/' target='blank'> Uncle Sam’s Pizza,</a> recently opened on Clinton Street.

The name and iconography of the restaurant struck me as quite random - what I am supposed to expect from an Uncle Sam’s Pizza? Red, white and blue slices? Sparklers in my garlic knots? Really, this place is a classic New York City pizza shop, a brick-lined wedge-space on Clinton Street about the width of my bedroom, with a big ol’ iron pizza oven and a variety of round and square pies showcased behind glass.

I was right away impressed by the sausage knuckles on their pepperoni-and-sausage slice - per the photo above, them things was PHAT. And of course, their spicy pepperoni square slice caught my eye, because, well, it’s a downtown Manhattan thing. Naturally, I had to see how their ‘roni square stacked up against the King Kong on Prince Street. I ordered the pepperoni-and-sausage and the spicy pepperoni square, and took a seat at their single outdoor countertop.

The pepperoni-and-sausage slice was great - a little crisp, but with enough give and grease in the crust to stand up to the hefty cuts of meat. I scarfed it down in t-minus three minutes, making sure to hide my savagery from passerby. Just a guy eating pizza like a dog at his last meal, nothing to see here….

Then came the Spicy Pepperoni Square, piled high with ‘ronis; I mean, there were little red grease cups falling all over the place. I gave the square a relatively clean fold, treating it more like a mozzarella and pepperoni sandwich. Each bite had a good proportion of cheese, sauce, and ‘roni - an important aspect in a pizza that could easily be overpowered by the meat. I definitely tasted a kick of spice, that kind of low-fi red pepper heat that makes for an entertaining chew.

I give Uncle Sam’s a 4 out of 5 - um - let's say stars, and will definitely be going back. These guys are new, but if they keep slinging out quality pies like I had today then I could definitely see them making some year-end Best of…’ lists. Plus, I’ve got to give props for keeping the dream alive in the Lower East Side, in a time where the easiest thing for most restaurateurs to do is shut their doors. It takes balls to open a pizza shop right now; mozzarella balls. **Chuckle chuckle** Know what I’m sayin’? Until next time.
